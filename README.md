# HNAG - Hôm Nay Ăn Gì (What Shall We Eat)

HNAG is a web app for internal use and a place for us to experience designing an enterprise like web, try out different technologies, languages and techniques.

## Description

HNAG comes from our need for a tool for managing our ordering, debt between us (could be more in the future). 
The services/modules are built independently with developer's own choice. 

## Modules

There are currently 5 modules:
1. Order module: taking, processing, managing orders from users. This service should be able to handle many request concurrently.
2. Debt module
3. Exhibition module
4. User module: authentication, the only gateway for frontend making contact with the services. 
5. Central module: the bridge that connect all services, dispatching request to the right service.
